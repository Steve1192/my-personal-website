    <div id ="mainbody">
   <p>This website is my personal story as a suffering Jets fan. I started being a jets fan as a little kid when I used to watch Jets games with my Mom's baby brother at my grandma's house. From that point on I knew I was hooked. My favorite color has always been green, and it was a point of pride to be a loyal Jets fan. Always rooting for our guys even when we suck or have tough years. I also really liked a lot of the head coaches of the jets over the years. Here is a list of my favorite former Jets head coaches.</p>
